1021,47-2,There is little time left before the presidential election and the launch of the Eurasian Union in 2015 as well as the looming prospect of the Association Agreement with the EU in November which adds pressure ,0,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.4,1.0,0.8,1.0
1022,47-3,Some experts in Ukraine assume that Putin s new stance is to reinforce ideological influence and keep Ukraine in the Russian World even if he has to let go of Kyiv in terms of trade and economics ,0,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.4,1.0,0.8,1.0
1023,47-4,His messages in Ukraine are indeed generously flavoured with rhetoric about unbreakable blood and spiritual bonds ,0,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8,1.0,1.4,1.0
1024,47-5,He mentioned this at the Russian and Ukrainian Navy parade in Sevastopol which he visited with Viktor Yanukovych referring to the strength of and devotion to the fundamentals of our predecessors who lived worked and protected their common Motherland together for centuries and made it powerful great and undefeated ,0,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.4,1.0,0.8,1.0
1025,47-6,We share common roots culture and religion ,0,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8,1.0,1.4,1.0
1026,47-7,Our blood and spiritual bonds are unbreakable ,0,1.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8,1.0,1.4,1.0
1027,47-8,Similar messages were expressed during religious ceremonies ,0,1.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8,1.0,1.4,1.0
1028,47-9,However they are nothing new in the Russian rhetoric of the past few years ,0,1.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.4,1.0,0.8,1.0
1029,47-10,Putin s speech at the Orthodox Slavic Values the Foundation of Ukraine s Civilization Choice Conference organized by Viktor Medvedchuk fueled diverse reactions from observers and experts ,0,0.8,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.4,1.0,0.8,1.0
1030,47-11,Notably Putin only spoke to Yanukovych for 15 minutes giving preference to Medvedchuk the father of his goddaughter ,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.4,1.0,0.8,1.0
1031,47-12,It appears that Putin was forced to stoop so low as Medvedchuk s Ukrainian Choice because there is no other alternative in Ukraine today ,0,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.4,1.0,0.8,1.0
1032,47-13,The failure of various Russian blocks and movements and the collapse of the Church Russian World led by Patriarch Kirill that has been more and more evident of late have left Putin with significantly less space and time to maneuver ,0,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.4,1.0,0.8,1.0
1033,47-14,At the moment he can only rely on the Communists who have zero prospects in Ukraine or the loyal Viktor Medvedchuk a notorious Chief of Staff during the Kuchma presidency and his Ukrainian Choice ,0,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.4,1.0,0.8,1.0
1034,47-15,No matter what Putin is no longer content with Yanukovych as his vassal in the gubernia that should be part of the Eurasian Union since the latter seems to have realized the danger of closer integration with the Kremlin for his estate ,0,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.4,1.0,0.8,1.0
1035,47-16,However Yanukovych s potential loss of power in 2015 is of even greater concern ,0,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.4,1.0,0.8,1.0
1036,47-17,The Family realizes that following the Russian model is its only chance to rapidly build a business empire that is equal to or larger than that of its friend Akhmetov ,0,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.4,1.0,0.8,1.0
1037,47-18,Given the experience of the past three years Yanukovych s Ukraine is open to humanitarian expansion from the East the inevitable russification of Ukraine s cultural and media space and the evolution of Ukraine s socio economic and socio political models in line with the Russian mould ,0,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.4,1.0,0.8,1.0
1038,47-19,But it will not cede its own interests which are completely focused on the rapid expansion of its business empire something that would be an integral part of Ukraine s integration into the Kremlin s neo imperial projects ,0,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.4,1.0,0.8,1.0
1039,47-20,Meanwhile Putin has once again made it clear that he will not be content with just a loyal state even a satellite ,0,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.4,1.0,0.8,1.0
1040,47-21,Instead he seeks to completely eliminate the aftermaths of the biggest geopolitical disaster of the 20 th century the collapse of the USSR and the emergence of an independent Ukraine ,0,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.4,1.0,0.8,1.0
1041,47-22,Only people like Viktor Medvedchuk who is considered to have pushed Kuchma to consent to integration in the Common Economic Space at the end of his presidency in 2003 can liquidate this abnormality which is not even a state as Putin put it in a conversation with George W Bush in Bucharest in 2008 ,0,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.4,1.0,0.8,1.0
1042,47-23,So far though Medvedchuk seems to be too weak to affect 2015 developments in Ukraine let alone seriously contribute to the disruption of the Association Agreement signing in November ,0,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.4,1.0,0.8,1.0
1043,47-24,All this puts Moscow under time pressure ,0,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.4,1.0,0.8,1.0
1044,47-25,Indeed the Association Agreement will not come into effect until ratified by all 28 EU member states and this could take years especially if hampered by the Kremlin s lobby in Europe ,0,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.4,1.0,0.8,1.0
1045,47-26,However the DCFTA as the economic part of the Association Agreement will come into effect immediately after signing and will be able to block Ukraine s integration in the Customs and Eurasian Unions ,0,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.4,1.0,0.8,1.0
1046,47-27,Therefore there is every reason to expect a surprise or two from the Kremlin before the Vilnius Summit in November ,0,0.8,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.4,1.0,0.8,1.0
1047,47-28,Similar things have occurred before when some events in foreign or internal policy threatened the Kremlin s stability ,0,1.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.4,1.0,0.8,1.0
1048,47-29,For instance a scandal similar to the alleged sale of Ukrainian Kolchuga ESM systems to Iraq that ruined Kuchma s relations with the West at the dawn of Putin s political career and his reintegration projects in the FSU ,0,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.4,1.0,0.8,1.0
1049,47-30,Or a new wave of mudslinging against the Ukrainian government this time bigger in terms of media coverage and with a stronger focus on Western politicians in order to ultimately convince the EU of the criminal nature of the Yanukovych regime and that the Association Agreement should not be signed with Ukraine ,0,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.4,1.0,0.8,1.0
1050,47-31,Meanwhile projects like the Ukrainian Choice or media holdings created to spread the word on the Kremlin s orders are apparently created specifically for the 2015 presidential race ,0,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.4,1.0,0.8,1.0
1051,47-32,They are probably supposed to expand the pro Russian electorate in Ukraine stealing it mainly from the former electorate of the Party of Regions and Yanukovych ,0,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.4,1.0,0.8,1.0
1052,47-33,Ukrainian Russian media are now fueling tension by presenting everything negatively from the decisions and actions of the government to social processes trends and developments ,0,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8,1.0,1.4,1.0
1053,47-34,It s possible that Putin is counting on a potential political vacuum in a number of southeastern regions that are currently under the total control of pro Russian Regionaires ,0,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.4,1.0,0.8,1.0
1054,47-35,This is a likely scenario if mass protests force Yanukovych to quit as in the 2004 scenario or if he loses the race to any of the pro European opposition leaders ,0,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.4,1.0,0.8,1.0
1055,47-36,Moscow already faced the huge risk of losing its influence over Ukraine for good in 2008 when the Ukrainian government applied for NATO s Membership Action Plan ,0,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.4,1.0,0.8,1.0
1056,47-37,Apparently it is preparing to respond to a similar threat after the 2015 election ,0,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.4,1.0,0.8,1.0
1057,47-38,The risks for Ukraine in this situation are aggravated by the fact that the Yanukovych regime does not view it as a fully fledged sovereign state and ignores national security ,0,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8,1.0,1.4,1.0
1058,47-39,This is evident from the choice of appointments to law enforcement authorities and special services where many generals who are openly pro Russian now serve ,0,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.4,1.0,0.8,1.0
1059,47-40,Therefore it will hardly be likely to develop an effective strategy to resist the possible special operations of Ukraine s strategic partner as the Vilnius Summit and the presidential election draw closer ,0,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.4,1.0,0.8,1.0
1060,47-41,Ukraine as a state is only valuable to the Family if it maintains power ,0,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.4,1.0,0.8,1.0
1061,47-42,This is why the regime will not develop any preventive measures for external scenarios that could hurt the country ,0,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.4,1.0,0.8,1.0
1062,47-43, It appears that Yanukovych still believes that the loss of power in 2004 was a coincidence a lack of preparedness for extreme scenarios and the betrayal of Kuchma ,0,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.4,1.0,0.8,1.0
1063,47-44,Therefore he may be confident of his ability to keep everything under control in 2015 ,0,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.4,1.0,0.8,1.0

2005,89-10,Unfortunately such orders never even reached the military structures ,0,0.8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6,1.0,0.6,1.0
2006,89-11,In the 20 hours following the order to launch exercises on the Black Sea Russia was capable of seizing three strategic sites on the Black Sea using approximately 150 special forces personnel ,0,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6,1.0,0.6,1.0

2008,89-13,The first news that the parliament and government building had been occupied mentioned only armed pro Russian individuals and this made it more difficult to take adequate measures ,0,0.2,0.0,0.6,0.0,0.6,1.0,0.6,1.0
2009,89-14,The military victory was clinched ,0,0.4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6,1.0,0.6,1.0
2010,89-15,The Ukrainian leadership and the rest of the world had been presented a fait accompli ,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6,1.0,0.6,1.0
2011,89-16,Throughout its invasion of Crimea Russia counted on two key factors to minimise the risk of bloodshed among its own forces and maximise the chances for success 1 A brand new Ukrainian central government in disarray and 2 No prospect for a military response by NATO ,0,0.4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6,1.0,0.6,1.0

2014,89-19,Above all an attack would similarly to Crimea focus on airfields and harbours that would make it possible to rapidly deploy additional forces into Estonia as well as on local government institutions which would have more of a political role ,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.5,0.6,1.0
2015,89-20,Unlike Crimea forces can also be deployed and fanned out across the country using the southeastern Estonian road network ,0,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.5,0.4,0.0
2016,89-21,The mobilisable reserve forces form the main bulwark of Estonia s military defences ,0,0.4,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.5,0.4,0.0
2017,89-22,The primary role of the Estonian Defence Forces in peacetime is to prepare reserve units by training conscripts and reservists ,0,0.4,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.5,0.4,0.0
2018,89-23,Less emphasis is laid on training professional units and sub units manned by members of the voluntary defence organisation Kaitseliit ,0,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.5,0.4,0.0
2019,89-24,In Estonia conscription is currently organised as a training cycle repeated at regular intervals ,0,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6,1.0,0.6,1.0
2020,89-25,Units manned by conscripts that have completed their training cycle do not remain on active duty ,0,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6,1.0,0.6,1.0
2021,89-26,Conscripts are assigned to the reserves and sent home ,0,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6,1.0,0.6,1.0
2022,89-27,To this point it has been considered a sound practice because since the 1990s the Russian armed forces have been considered to have their hands full dealing with internal problems ,0,0.4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6,1.0,0.6,1.0
2023,89-28,Thus Estonian defence planners assumed that the security environment would deteriorate only gradually allowing the country s political and military leaders time to calmly prepare and procure more ammunition mobilise reserve units and carry out additional training ,0,0.4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6,1.0,0.6,1.0
2024,89-29,Today it is obvious that the general security situation has grown significantly worse ,0,1.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6,1.0,0.6,1.0
2025,89-30,Should a Crimea scenario arise the Estonian Defence Forces would not have time to mobilise reserve units ,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6,1.0,0.6,1.0
2026,89-31,Moreover there would be no point in pitting conscripts with only limited training against Russian special forces who would already have seized and taken up defence of sites of strategic importance ,0,1.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6,1.0,0.6,1.0
2027,89-32,If we analyse the dates when conscripts are called up for compulsory military service in 2014 and the number of conscripts we see that only in the first five months of the year there are significant number of conscripts who would be capable of operating at least on a platoon level ,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6,1.0,0.6,1.0
2028,89-33,The Defence Forces also have a smaller contingent consisting of rapid response units above all the Scouts Battalion and also a special operations unit manned with active duty personnel ,0,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6,1.0,0.6,1.0
2029,89-34,In recent years Kaitseliit has increased its membership at a stable pace and as of the end of 2012 the organisation had around 13 200 active members ,0,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6,1.0,0.6,1.0
2030,89-35,Yet caution should be exercised in using this number because all active members do not belong to units that have trained together although their commitment to defend their country can be assumed to be high ,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6,1.0,0.6,1.0
2031,89-36,According to the new national defence development plan Estonia s military defence capacity will grow significantly in the decade ahead ,0,0.4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6,1.0,0.6,1.0
2032,89-37,Larger numbers however do not necessarily ensure sufficient security in a situation where a highly capable enemy is acting decisively ,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6,1.0,0.6,1.0
2033,89-38,An attacker may intentionally sow doubts as to whether the country has fallen victim to aggression or whether it is merely a criminal group that has managed to occupy a building ,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6,1.0,0.6,1.0
2034,89-39,This fog may cause mobilisation to be put off so long that the adversary could occupy key sites and thereby make mobilisation difficult if not impossible ,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6,1.0,0.6,1.0
2035,89-40,The deployment of allied forces to Estonia before or during a possible military attack is one of the most important aspects of NATO membership ,0,0.4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6,1.0,0.6,1.0
2036,89-41,The main value of belonging to the alliance lies in military deterrence through all members commitment to collective defines under Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty which should lead potential adversaries to abandon the idea of military aggression in the first place ,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6,1.0,0.6,1.0
2037,89-42,But if a Crimea type creeping invasion scenario involving special forces should come to pass Estonia would have very limited immediate support from the allied units ,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.2,1.0,0.6,1.0
2038,89-43,The NATO Air Policing Mission even with its recent strengthening in response to Russia s invasion of Ukraine would offer primarily symbolic support ,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.2,1.0,0.6,1.0
2039,89-44,The key deterrent is therefore deployment of NATO ground troops to Estonia either permanently or by prepositioning equipment allowing the units personnel to be deployed relatively quickly if a crisis develops ,0,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6,1.0,0.6,1.0
2040,89-45,A new aspect seen with regard to Russia is its ability to incite revolts and unrest on foreign soil while rapidly deploying military forces to aggravate and exploit the resultant political turmoil ,0,0.4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6,1.0,0.6,1.0
2041,89-46,The question is about what measures Estonia could implement to allow it to respond immediately and forcefully to military aggression ,0,0.8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6,1.0,0.6,1.0
2042,89-47,On the national level the transition from peacetime to wartime must be seamless and ensure continuity of leadership ,0,0.4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6,1.0,0.6,1.0
2043,89-48,Command exercises must be regularly held for Estonia s political and military leaders ,0,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6,1.0,0.6,1.0
2044,89-49,The responsibility of every government agency should as a crisis deepens remain as little changed as possible without complex and risky transitions ,0,0.8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6,1.0,0.6,1.0
2045,89-50,The simplest and most logical move is to base all activities that take place across all agencies in both peacetime and wartime on a uniform set of principles ,0,0.4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6,1.0,0.6,1.0
2046,89-51,Estonia will always be unable to win a war of sheer numbers against its eastern neighbour so it must focus on quality ,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6,1.0,0.6,1.0
2047,89-52,This will require units in a high state of readiness fully manned well trained and equipped ,0,0.4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6,1.0,0.6,1.0
2048,89-53,The question facing Estonian defines planners is therefore whether the Defence Forces in the future should focus on reserves or on ensuring the existence of highly capable units that can be used immediately ,0,0.4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6,1.0,0.6,1.0
2049,89-54,The events in Crimea show that the latter should be a priority ,0,0.4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6,1.0,0.6,1.0
2050,89-55,Undoubtedly radical measures should be considered such as increasing the number of units manned with active duty personnel ,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6,1.0,0.6,1.0
2051,89-56,Another possibility is to extend the duration of conscription so that the units that are trained during compulsory military service are not immediately assigned to the reserves but instead left on active duty for a time ,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6,1.0,0.6,1.0
2052,89-57,This is the option being explored in Norway where an 18 month term of service is being attempted that would allow conscripts to be used for up to six months ,0,0.4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6,1.0,0.6,1.0
2053,89-58,Kaitseliit too should include sub units at a high state of readiness with a training level and equipment that allows them to be used against an opponent s elite units ,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6,1.0,0.6,1.0
2054,89-59,In parallel to Estonia s efforts its NATO allies should be asked to increase its presence in the Baltic States one that goes beyond NATO s current Air Policing Mission ,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.2,1.0,0.6,1.0
2055,89-60,In the light of Russia s aggression against Georgia and Ukraine the lack of a NATO military presence in a state neighbouring Russia appears to provide an incentive for Moscow to consider using force to pursue political objectives ,0,0.4,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.2,1.0,0.6,1.0
2056,89-61,Thus the permanent stationing of NATO ground units and or prepositioning of equipment in some of the Baltic States could be of critical importance to deterring potential aggressors in coming months and years ,0,0.4,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.2,1.0,0.6,1.0
